# Getting Started with HPE NonStop Guardian

HPE NonStop Guardian is a robust operating system designed for mission-critical environments that require high availability and fault tolerance. This guide will help you get started with the basics of NonStop Guardian.

Watch [this video](https://vimeo.com/showcase/7776942/video/479116681) to understand the basic concepts of the NonStop system! 

## System Access

To begin working with NonStop Guardian, you'll need to access the system through a terminal emulator. The most common method is using [MR-Win6530, a Windows-based terminal emulator specifically designed for NonStop systems](https://www.comforte.com/fileadmin/Collateral/FS_MRWin6530.pdf).

### TACL: Your Command Interface

Once connected, you'll interact with the system using TACL (Tandem Advanced Command Language). TACL is the primary command-line interface for Guardian.

Here are some basic TACL commands to get you started:

- `LOGON [username]`: Log into the system
- `VOLUME [$disk.subvolume]`: Change the current subvolume
- `FILES`: List files in the current subvolume
- `TYPE`: Display the contents of a file
- `EDIT`: Open the text editor to create or modify files
- `RUN`: Execute a program
- `HELP`: Display help information for commands

### File System Structure

Guardian uses a hierarchical file system structure:

- System: The top level, represented by a backslash ($$
- Volume: A disk or logical partition, e.g., $DATA
- Subvolume: A directory-like structure within a volume
- File: Individual files within a subvolume

A full file name might look like this: \SYSTEM.$DATA.MYSUBVOL.MYFILE

### Process Management

Guardian processes are identified by a process name or a process ID. Use the `STATUS` command to view running processes and the `STOP` command to terminate a process.

### Security

Guardian uses a robust security model. Users are assigned to user groups, and access to files and other system resources is controlled through access control lists (ACLs).

### Developing Applications

For application development, Guardian supports various programming languages, including COBOL, C, C++, and Java. The specific development environment will depend on your chosen language and tools.

### Monitoring and Management

Guardian provides several tools for system monitoring and management:

- Measure: Performance monitoring subsystem
- Pathway: Transaction processing environment
- TMF (Transaction Management Facility): For managing distributed transactions

As you become more familiar with Guardian, you'll discover its powerful features for ensuring high availability, scalability, and data integrity in mission-critical environments.

Remember, this is just a starting point. HPE provides comprehensive documentation and training resources to help you master the NonStop Guardian environment.
